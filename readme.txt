Logs any calls to deprecated functions, files, or arguments, and identifies the function that made the call. Handy for plugin and theme authors.

== Description ==

Logs any calls to deprecated functions, files, or arguments, and identifies the function that made the call.  This should be very useful for plugin and theme authors who want to keep their code up-to-date with current WordPress standards.  Deprecated calls are logged via error_log() -- so they should show up in your regular PHP log file.

There is an admin screen under the "Plugins" menu.  There you can toggle logging to PHP log or a table in the WordPress Database.  You can also see records from that table (if any), and run a "test" that calls a dummy deprecated function, includes a dummy deprecated file, and calls a function with a deprecated argument.

== Screenshots ==

1.  The Manage page found under Plugins > Deprecated Calls

== Installation ==

Pretty much like any other WordPress Plugin.  Upload to Plugins directory.

Simply activate to record deprecated calls to your PHP log, or visit the Admin page under Plugins for other options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work for themes too? =

Yes. It works for any code running within WordPress, including Themes and Plugins. You can even use it when testing patches for WordPress Core.
